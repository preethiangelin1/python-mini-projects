# Caesar Cipher

A simple command-line implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique using Python.

This project allows users to encode or decode messages by shifting characters based on a given number.

## 📌 Description
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques, where each character in a message is shifted forward or backward by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

This program:
- Encrypts text by shifting characters forward
- Decrypts text by shifting characters backward
- Runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- String manipulation
- ASCII values (`ord()` and `chr()`)
- User input handling

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Clone the repository or download the file
3. Navigate to the project folder
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
